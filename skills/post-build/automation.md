# Wiring post-build into an automation

Operator guide for triggering the `post-build` stage from an external automation. Portable; the worked example is a Cursor Automation, adapt the mechanics for other harnesses. Not loaded during skill execution.

## Shape: one orchestrated automation per stage

The pipeline chains at **stage seams**, through the PR: the build stage lands a PR carrying the `Workflow-Plan:` marker, and that PR is the entire handoff into post-build. Within the stage, run **one automation** whose parent orchestrates all phases as subagents — do not split the phases (review / remediation / QA plan / checks / deploy / QA) into separately triggered automations:

- The stage's cross-phase state — classification, candidate SHA, exact deployment URL, remediation and QA cycle counts, final results — is exactly the state that must never be committed. Chained automations hand off through commits or trigger payloads; a single run holds it in the parent.
- Bounded loops need one authority that remembers. Chained runs would reconstruct cycle counts from artifact archaeology, and a retrigger loop is one parsing bug away.
- The stage commits to the PR branch it watches. A push-triggered chain refires on its own artifact commits; a single automation triggered once has no feedback edge.
- Phase independence already exists inside the run — each phase is a fresh subagent context — so chaining adds trigger plumbing without adding independence.
- Right-sizing (absorb vs orchestrate, skip QA/deploy) is a single-run judgment; splitting phases across triggers would re-litigate classification at every hop.

Merging stays outside by default: the automation ends at the merge-readiness report. Auto-merge is a declared prompt coda only (see below), never inferred from a PASS.

## Trigger

Trigger **once per build handoff**, not on every push to the branch:

- Preferred: PR opened / marked ready-for-review by the build agent, or a dedicated label (e.g. `post-build`) the build stage applies.
- Manual/operator trigger is equally valid; garcia-music runs this way.
- If the harness only offers push triggers, add a guard to the prompt: exit immediately when the head commit is the stage's own artifact commit (`REVIEW.md`/`QA.md`/remediation), so the automation cannot feed itself.
- Pass an explicit plan-folder path in trigger context only to override discovery; normally the PR's `Workflow-Plan:` marker is sufficient.
- Trivial non-functional PRs may still enter this automation; the skill is expected to classify, read the required checks at the end, and exit early with an absorbed report rather than running the full stage.

## Re-runs and resumability

A re-triggered run resumes; it does not repeat. During preflight, treat committed artifacts already bound to the current candidate SHA as done: a `REVIEW.md` whose recorded SHA matches HEAD and whose verdict is `PASS`/`PASS_WITH_FOLLOWUPS` skips straight past review; an existing `QA.md` matrix skips QA planning; recorded remediation cycles count against the bounded loops. Only unproven phases run. This makes a late flaky failure (usually checks, deploy, or QA) cheap to retry without weakening any gate.

## Configure the automation

1. Create one automation with an orchestrator-capable parent model, granted access to the repository's non-production branches only.
2. Make the workflow plugin's core skills available in the automation context via the plugin's documented install path — do not vendor them into the repository. Harnesses differ on how skills surface (registry listing vs project-local paths); the prompt below accepts either.
3. Ensure the repository carries its **adapter skill**, conventionally named `post-build-automation` (production boundaries, required checks, deploy-proof commands, QA environment, worker routing), with `disable-model-invocation: true` so only the automation loads it.
4. Add the secrets the adapter names to the automation's environment. Pass variable names in prompts, never values.
5. Use the canonical prompt below. Add no extra workflow policy — policy lives in the skill and the adapter, where it is versioned. The prompt is a stage map and load instruction only; do not restate safety invariants, resumability, or the final output schema.

## Canonical prompt template

Replace the bracketed values; keep the rest verbatim. The skill owns phase mechanics, safety, resumability, and the report schema — this prompt only starts the stage and right-sizes the parent.

```text
Run the post-build workflow for <PR / current non-production branch>.

Load the workflow plugin's `post-build` skill for portable stage semantics,
and the repo's `post-build-automation` adapter skill if it exists. Prefer the
harness skill registry / available-skills list. If a named skill is missing
there, resolve it from the usual install locations without inventing a new
layout: Cursor project skills under `.cursor/skills/workflow/`; Claude Code
under `~/.claude/skills/` or a repo `.claude/skills/`; the adapter may also
live under the repo's skill tree under the same name.

You are the parent: coordinate by default; absorb only trivial/small
non-functional changes. Dispatch each worker by naming its worker skill plus
the run's situational context.

Resolve plan context from the PR's Workflow-Plan marker, or classify as
ad-hoc when none is needed.

Classify the change (intent source, surface, size), then right-size:
- delegate independent review first (the reviewer fixes straightforward
  findings in place; only briefed structural findings get a fixer and a
  fresh verification);
- then QA planning, exact-SHA deploy proof, and
- deployed browser QA only when the change is functional with driveable
  user-facing need.

Read required checks once at the end of the work — for functional,
non-trivial changes, allow one bounded fix cycle when this PR caused the
failure; otherwise report it and leave it failing.
```

## Optional merge coda (declared opt-in)

Merging stays **outside** the portable stage by default: the skill ends at the
merge-readiness report. If an automation should merge after a clean run, append
this coda explicitly — do not fold it into the skill, and do not treat
`PASS_WITH_FOLLOWUPS` or absorbed non-functional work as auto-merge fuel.

```text
After the stage returns its final output schema, approve and merge only when
all of these hold: Status is PASS, required checks are green, no blocker or
high residuals remain, and the change is not large / high-blast-radius
functional work. Otherwise leave the PR open with the merge-readiness report.
```

## Pre-wiring checklist

- [ ] Build stage lands PRs with `Workflow-Plan: docs/plans/<NN>-<slug>/` as the first body line (ad-hoc/no-plan PRs are still handled via classification).
- [ ] Adapter skill named `post-build-automation` exists and supplies: production boundaries, required checks, deploy-proof + health-check mechanics, QA identities and sign-in routes, environment setup, worker/model routing.
- [ ] Automation has the adapter's named secrets and non-production repo access.
- [ ] Trigger fires once per handoff (or carries the self-commit guard).
- [ ] If using the merge coda: confirm it is an intentional opt-in and that `PASS_WITH_FOLLOWUPS` / absorbed runs stay human-gated.

## Canary

Before trusting the wiring, run once against a known-good already-built PR. Expect: classification in the report; for a functional planned PR, committed `REVIEW.md` (verdict + reviewed SHA, straightforward findings resolved in the review itself) and matrix-only `QA.md` on the branch when QA applies, the end-of-work required-checks read reflected in the report, exact-SHA deployment proof only when QA ran, QA driven only against that URL, final results in the automation/PR output with **no trailing results commit**. Also canary a trivial docs-only PR: expect absorbed mode, checks read and reported (never fixed), QA/deploy skipped, no invented plan folder. Any deviation is a wiring or adapter bug — fix it before putting the automation in the path of real PRs.
