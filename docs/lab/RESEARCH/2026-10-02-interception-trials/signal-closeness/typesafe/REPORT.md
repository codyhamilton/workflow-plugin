# PR-SIGNAL-CLOSENESS — TypeSafe Wave-3 seat

Status: **pre-seat manifest ready; model cells pending**  
Scope: maps-only measurement; not a behaviour ship.

## Pins and gates

- Protocol: `protocol-v0-atomic.json`
  - SHA-256: `5f54251e6168ad35e67a0c192bacd1a03b1d05814bc56565373453fbc9206d52`
  - verified before manifest generation and before every model run
- Panel: `panel-v0.json`
  - SHA-256: `e36fcebc51da2e9b6be21de49457a1da0a82c60eceaa8991ae644c39b4adec67`
  - verified before manifest generation and before every model run
- Inventory: `INVENTORY-READY.md`, status `READY`; no `WAVE3-INVENTORY-STATUS.md` was present
- Driver/model: TypeSafe / `jev-1.13.0`
- `call_jev`: false; `:8080`: kept unloaded
- Replicates: 2; preferred checkpoint: 75
- Holdouts: 25 present in the panel and not scored
- Residual pack path: repository gold hybrid packs at
  `docs/lab/RESEARCH/2026-10-01-progressive-jev-session-gates/proofs/validated/gold/packs/`
  for `0aab88c525de` and `036ff3ed4a89`, reused at checkpoint 75

## Zero-call gate

The profile was built offline from cumulative pack fields and last-n excerpts
before any TypeSafe POST:

| signal | zero_call_separation | model | evidence | outcome |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `thrash` | true | skipped | reread paths + compaction: high mean 42.0 vs low mean 5.5 | PASS — zero-call separated |
| `poll` | true | skipped | Monitor + wait terms: high mean 15.0 vs low mean 1.5 | PASS — zero-call separated |
| `productive_edit` | true | skipped | Edit + Write: high mean 9.0 vs low mean 0.0 | PASS — zero-call separated |
| `validation_inflection` | false | eligible | profile skipped by design; `prompt_plus_last_n` required | pending model result |

The `bb6165018de0` caution is retained: `write_count=1` is recorded, but its
poll-side offline score remains in the poll high-side profile because the
zero-call metric is Monitor plus wait terms, not Write absence.

## Planned TypeSafe cells

One multi-ask request contains the independent `validation_inflection` float
ask. There is no union, winner, fire, or holdout ask. The full cell manifest is
in `cell-manifest.json`.

| worker | stratum | replicate 1 | replicate 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `92a48e004519` | thrash | `26a32082c4344511` | `b4623b8c298c5761` |
| `ca977b9ca0dd` | thrash | `8c62a9300a497738` | `0cc1d1ad9f0bc182` |
| `87a380bc64ff` | poll | `c816f3e034e48595` | `b8338a1a47f1fc00` |
| `bb6165018de0` | poll | `57f2efe4358d40ad` | `dc350173ede5c0c2` |

| `074c8cf22927` | productive_edit | `d74e4ed2c32089ef` | `35f03fb2e567bd55` |
| `0aab88c525de` | validation_inflection | `8c79d48cac6ec8b9` | `2596bd2ba1b821a7` |
| `036ff3ed4a89` | validation_inflection | `70b4f607175a15b7` | `be532e8042afdcaa` |

## Analysis rule

For the only model-seated signal, compare the replicate-level valid float
means for the residual high side (`0aab88c525de`, `036ff3ed4a89`) against the
stable thrash plus clean productive-edit low side. A strictly higher high-side
mean passes; flat or reversed kills. This is a closeness result, not a
behaviour or intervention decision.

## Results

Results are written append-only to `results.jsonl`; request/response captures
are under the ignored `raw/` directory. This section is updated after seating.
