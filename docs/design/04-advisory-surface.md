# Design Intent 4: Agent Advisory Surface

What the agent can ask the system, through the local shim. Part of
[system-architecture.md](system-architecture.md); the shim's plumbing is in
[02-edge-capture.md](02-edge-capture.md#mcp-shim) and the service it reads is
[03-remote-service.md](03-remote-service.md).

## Problem

The current MCP has sixteen tools. Most exist to feed the dataset (`post_design`,
`start_execution`, `complete_execution`, …), and the skills require the agent to call them, which is
what principle 1 removes. The agent still benefits from a few answers that change what it does in
this run: whether its artifact arrived and how it was judged, what it will be judged on, and what
similar work exists.

## Shape

`workflow mcp` is a stdio MCP server, spawned by each harness, reading the client config
(design 2). It forwards to the service's advisory reads and adds local queue state. Every tool is
read-only.

| Tool | Answers | Changes the agent's decision by |
|---|---|---|
| `artifact_feedback(path)` | for the file at `path`: delivery state of its current content, screen verdict, scores per check with the tenant's baseline for that kind | telling it to fix a refusal, or revise a criterion that is out of norm, before moving on |
| `list_checks(kind)` | the checks a design, brief or report is scored against | letting it write to the rubric rather than discover it afterwards |
| `search_artifacts(query, kind?)` | similar past designs, briefs and reports in this tenant, with path, repo and a snippet | reusing or contrasting prior work |

Nothing else is exposed. Maintainer operations (defining checks, rescoring, rating) are CLI or REST
only.

## `artifact_feedback`

The shim resolves `path` against the working directory, reads the file, and hashes it. Then, in
order:

1. **Queued.** Any queue file whose envelope refers to `path` after normalisation (resolved
   against the envelope's `cwd`, then made repo-relative with the drain's function). The shim parses
   each queue file to check; the queue is normally a handful of files, so this is accepted. If present, the shim kicks the drain,
   waits up to about 1.5 s, and re-checks. Still queued: report count, oldest age, and why
   (`bad config`, `remote unreachable`, `draining`).
2. **Rejected.** Any `rejected/` file for `path`: report the reason. The fix is to rewrite the file;
   that fires a new hook.
3. **Delivered.** Ask the service for `(repo_id, path)`: the latest version's hash, its screen
   verdict, and its scores. If that hash differs from the file's current hash, say the current
   content is not yet delivered, which is normally a write still in the batch window.

Matching is by path and content hash, not by conversation. The shim is not told which conversation
spawned it, and an artifact written in an earlier conversation is still answerable.

The repo ID is computed by the shim the same way the drain computes it (design 1).

## API

Service reads behind the tools. All need the key, all are scoped to the key's tenant.

| Request | Response |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/artifacts?repo_id=&path=` | `{"repo_id","path","kind","versions":n,"latest":{"content_hash","received_at","conversation_id","source","screen":{"verdict","scorer","at"}\|null,"scores":[{"check","score"}]}}`, or 404 |
| `GET /v1/checks?kind=` | `{"checks":[{"kind","name","q","levels","invert"}]}` |
| `GET /v1/baselines?kind=` | `{"kind","checks":{"<name>":{"n","p25","median","p75"}}}` over the latest version of each artifact of that kind |
| `GET /v1/search?q=&kind=&limit=` | `{"hits":[{"repo_id","path","kind","content_hash","snippet","rank"}]}` |

`search` is SQLite FTS5 over the latest screened content of each artifact (`passed` or
`unscreened`), ranked by `bm25`, with `snippet()` for the excerpt; `limit` defaults to 10. Nothing
smarter in this round.

## Scores and baselines

Scores are per check, 0 to 1, as the scorer returns them. The baseline is the tenant's median and
interquartile range per check for the same kind. A check below the lower quartile is flagged. As in
the current skills, ratings are comparative: the outlier is the signal, not the number.

## Unreachable service

The shim never fails a tool call because the service is down. It answers with what it knows locally
(queued, rejected) and says the service is unreachable. A missing config says so and names the
file.

## What changes in the skills

- `design`, `refine` and `execute` stop requiring `post_design`, `post_brief`, `patch_*`,
  `start_execution`, `patch_execution` and `complete_execution`. Writing the file is the
  submission (principle 1).
- Where a skill required ratings to be reported, it calls `artifact_feedback` after writing and
  reports flagged checks.
- Frontmatter IDs (`design_id`, `brief_id`) are dropped from templates; the artifact key is
  `(repo_id, path)`.
- Commit titles drop `[exec <id>]`. The execution is a derived view keyed by conversation
  (design 1); `Workflow-Phase:` trailers stay, since phase closure is a repo fact.
- The execution report at `docs/plans/<plan>/reports/<brief-name>.md` becomes a required output of
  each worker (design 1).

## Registration

Every harness registers the shim as a stdio command through the wrapper (design 5):
`bin/workflow mcp`. The HTTP registration of `127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` is removed.

## Tests

1. Over stdio against a temp service: `initialize`, `tools/list` shows exactly the three tools,
   each call returns.
2. `artifact_feedback` for a file that is queued, rejected, delivered, and delivered at an older
   hash gives the four distinct answers.
3. Service down: the call returns local state and says so, with no MCP error.
